## About
Spirit Showdown is a turn-based two-player web-app board game that takes inspiration from the now defunct 2016 mobile game Pok√©mon Duel. What makes Spirit Showdown unique is that all characters and their sprite are are randomly generated to create a unique gaming experience every time!

## How to Play
The game board contains several kinds of tiles, the most important of which are the player spawn tiles. Each player has their own spawn tiles, which are the only tiles by which their spirits can enter the board. The objective of the game is to block your opponent's spawn tiles, preventing them from spawning in new spirits and winning you the game. <br>
